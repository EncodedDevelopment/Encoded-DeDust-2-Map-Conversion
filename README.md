# Encoded-DeDust-2-Map-Conversion
DeDust map from CS 1.6 converted to fivem for Nass_Paintball 



The map uses custom materials and custom colissions to work with fivem and formated to a rage engine stream format.

Installation:
Copt the map resouce into your resources directory and ensure it.

Head to nass_paintball/html/images
copy the dust.png to that location

head to nass_paintball/config.lua and add the following code

Copy the config setup thats saved in the text file inside the resource

Please note that a full server restart is required

Why C.S 1.6 ?

Its an extremely optimized model and will garantee zero performance impact

The map is best desgined for small teams  1v1 to 4v4 but can go up to full lobby in Nass Paintball

Note : I know there already exists such a map on GTV mods, i ensure you this is my map and the two will differ a lot on various things.
